I built my blog a few years ago, starting with Ghost and moving to WordPress. Today, it's running on WordPress with the GeneratePress theme. I use most of GeneratePress's premium functionality on the website; for instance, the cool cards on the homepage were created using GeneratePress Elements.

I occasionally post on my blog, typically about cool technical things I've found while tinkering. Give it a read [here](https://blog.unixfy.net)!
