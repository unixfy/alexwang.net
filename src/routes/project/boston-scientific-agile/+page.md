For this project, a team of USC students and I collaborated with a former USC Industrial and Systems Engineering PhD student now working at Boston Scientific as a program manager on an app called *mySCS*. Her role meant she had a birds-eye view of the mySCS team's botched implementation of the agile methodology, where the team suffered from frequent unplanned work and long / unpredictable sprints.

During this project, the team and I conducted interviews of the mySCS team to understand their requirements. We then studied the agile methodology, agile manifesto, and agile case studies to understand how the agile methodology could be better implemented. I also leveraged my previous experience administering Jira deployments to provide Jira-specific suggestions to mySCS. We delivered our findings in a comprehensive presentation and project report.
