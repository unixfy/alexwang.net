This is the website for the robotics team that I'm on. It's a large WordPress site with a custom theme coded by our website team (which I lead today) a few years ago. It has nearly 1000 pages and 2000 pictures on the site -- a very large site indeed!

My team and I update the site with new content (new students, new photos, blog posts, etc.). I also keep everything in working order, particularly regarding the theme (which is not compatible with Gutenberg and other new WordPress features); and gradually introduce new features to the site. For instance, I recentlyÂ [integrated custom post types into the site](https://blog.unixfy.net/easier-editing-for-repetitive-data-in-wordpress/), reducing the time needed for basic data entry tasks (like creating new student pages) dramatically.

In the future, I plan to either rewrite the theme to adhere to modern standards, or even transition to a headless model where the WordPress install serves only as an API for a JAMStack-based frontend.
